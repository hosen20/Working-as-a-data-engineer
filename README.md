Welcome to this project in which we are going to take a look at our friend Angelina who works as a data engineer.
Angelina will explain to us 3 of the projects she will be working on in the domians of sentiment analysis of twitter reviews, text extraction from images and object detection in images.

1. Sentiment analysis of twitter reviews:
In the first project Angelina worked on a dataset containing more than 14000 reviews from customers about US Airlines. She first started by getting the tweets stored in an online MongoDB database, then performing some cleaning on the tweets, after that she used Spark NLP and matplotlib to find that most of the reviews are negative. Us Airlines should take serious actions to decrease the number of unsatisfied customers.
MongoDB is used by their company since they need to store different formats of data, like images and texts.

2. Extracting texts from images:
In the second project, Angelina was given the job of extracting customer reviews from online posted images. We all know that these days reviews can be also in an image form instead of a text form. We will end with explaining some of the advantages and disadvantages of this approach.

3. Finding the thieves using object detection:
In the last project, the company in which Angelina works recieved a big number of images from the police to help them detect if a car is in the image and to find the car plate to further help them in their investigation about stolen cars and criminals. Lets Go!!
